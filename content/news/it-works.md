That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.
